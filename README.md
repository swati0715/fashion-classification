# fashion-classification
This project builds a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras to classify clothing images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizations.

Key Features:- Uses the Fashion MNIST dataset (10 clothing categories, 28Ã—28 grayscale images) Implements a simple neural network (or CNN) with Keras Trains and evaluates the model on real-world fashion image data Visualizes predictions and training performance

Technologies:- Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, seaborn,
